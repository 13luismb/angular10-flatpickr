See standard-version for commit guidelines.\n\n6.0.0 (2018-07-02)\nFeatures\n\nupdate flatpickr to latest version (c407b3e)\n\nBREAKING CHANGES\n\nflatpickrFactory and FLATPICKR injection token are no longer needed and were removed. To migrate just remove the first argument you pass to FlatpickrModule.forRoot\n\nA minimum version of flatpickr 4.5.0 or higher is now required to use this library\n\n5.0.2 (2018-06-20)\nBug Fixes\n\nparse date in same way as flatpickr does it (9e38827)\ndirective: fix setDisabledState behaviour (eac1055)\n\n\n5.0.1 (2018-05-16)\nBug Fixes\n\nmark the form control when touched (d3c783e)\nmark the input as disabled when used with reactive forms (2c1122c), closes #15\n\n\n5.0.0 (2017-12-24)\nFeatures\n\nupgrade to angular 5 (d764610)\n\nBREAKING CHANGES\n\nAngular 5 or higher is now required to use this package\n\n\n4.0.1 (2017-11-08)\nBug Fixes\n\nallow angular 5 peer dependency (684395e)\n\n\n4.0.0 (2017-10-22)\nBug Fixes\n\naot: allow the lib to compile with aot (12c76e8), closes #7\n\nBREAKING CHANGES\n\naot: the value you pass to the forRoot method for flatpickr has changed. The new signature is:\n\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport * as flatpickr from 'flatpickr';\nimport { FlatpickrModule, FLATPICKR } from 'angularx-flatpickr';\n\nexport function flatpickrFactory() {\n  return flatpickr;\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    FlatpickrModule.forRoot({\n      provide: FLATPICKR,\n      useFactory: flatpickrFactory\n    })\n  ]\n})\nclass MyModule {}\n3.0.0 (2017-10-18)\nBug Fixes\n\nsupport latest flatpickr (b66000d)\n\nFeatures\n\nupgrade flatpickr to v4 (0fa4335), closes #4 #5\n\nBREAKING CHANGES\n\nflatpickr is now a peer dependency of this module. You must now add it as an\nexplicit dependency, import it and pass it to the first argument of FlatpickrModule.forRoot\n\n\n2.0.1 (2017-08-17)\nBug Fixes\n\nupdate model value even if convertModelValue is false (cd5374a)\nuse input event instead of change event to detect flatpicker changes (fc6f751)\n\n\n2.0.0 (2017-08-11)\nBug Fixes\n\nmake the directive to work with reactive forms (e619706), closes #1\n\nFeatures\n\nupgrade flatpickr to v3 (ea73c66)\n\nBREAKING CHANGES\n\nflatpickr has been upgraded to v3. The utc was removed from this lib as it was\nremoved from flatpickr\nthe forms module is now required to use this component\n\n\n1.0.0 (2017-04-07)\nFeatures\n\ninitial implementation (acbd9ac)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"dependencies.html":{"url":"dependencies.html","title":"package-dependencies - dependencies","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Peer Dependencies\n    \n    \n        \n            @angular/core : >=5.0.0\n        \n            @angular/forms : >=5.0.0\n        \n            flatpickr : ^4.5.0\n    \n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"miscellaneous/functions.html":{"url":"miscellaneous/functions.html","title":"miscellaneous-functions - functions","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Miscellaneous\n  Functions\n\n\n\n    Index\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            defaultsFactory   (src/.../flatpickr.module.ts)\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    src/flatpickr.module.ts\n    \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                            defaultsFactory\n                            \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                    \ndefaultsFactory(userDefaults: undefined)\n                    \n                \n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n\n                            \n                                    Parameters :\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            \n                                                Name\n                                                Optional\n                                            \n                                        \n                                        \n                                                \n                                                        userDefaults\n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                            no\n                                                    \n                                                    \n\n                                                \n                                        \n                                    \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"index.html":{"url":"index.html","title":"getting-started - index","body":"\n                   \n\nangularx flatpickr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemo\nhttps://mattlewis92.github.io/angularx-flatpickr/\nTable of contents\n\nAbout\nInstallation\nDocumentation\nDevelopment\nLicense\n\nAbout\nAn angular 5.0+ wrapper for flatpickr\nInstallation\nInstall through npm:\nnpm install --save flatpickr angularx-flatpickrThen include in your apps module:\nimport 'flatpickr/dist/flatpickr.css';
